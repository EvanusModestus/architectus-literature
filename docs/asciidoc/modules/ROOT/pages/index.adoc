== Why Read in Original

Reading in the original language provides:

* **Nuance** — translations lose subtlety
* **Rhythm** — poetry demands original meter
* **Culture** — idioms carry cultural weight
* **Etymology** — word choices reveal meaning
* **Growth** — the best language practice

== Don Quijote

The first modern novel. A meditation on identity, reality, and the power of narrative.
